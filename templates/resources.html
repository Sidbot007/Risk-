        <h1>Introduction</h1>
            <p>The term “heart disease” is often used interchangeably with the term “cardiovascular disease”. Cardiovascular disease generally refers to conditions that involve narrowed or blocked blood vessels that can lead to a heart attack, chest pain (angina) or stroke. Other heart conditions, such as those that affect your heart’s muscle, valves or rhythm, also are considered forms of heart disease.

                Heart disease is one of the biggest causes of morbidity and mortality among the population of the world. Prediction of cardiovascular disease is regarded as one of the most important subjects in the section of clinical data analysis. The amount of data in the healthcare industry is huge. Data mining turns the large collection of raw healthcare data into information that can help to make informed decisions and predictions.Heart disease is a major cause of death in the world. It is important to know the risk factors for heart disease and take steps to prevent it. This tool can help you estimate your risk of developing heart disease in the next 10 years. It is based on the Framingham Heart Study, which is a long-term study of heart disease risk factors. The tool takes into account some of the major risk factors for heart disease, such as age and cholesterol levels. It can help you and your doctor make decisions about how to reduce your risk of heart disease.</p>
